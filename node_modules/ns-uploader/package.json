This is faster but has the restriction: each folder first-level files cannot weight more than 100mb in total.\n * add: it upload file by file. precondition: target folder must be empty. Restriction is minimal: each file cannot weight more than 100mb. \n * add_update: the same as add but first it checks if the file already exists and in that case update its content. Preconditions: none. This is the one should be used for 'gulp deploy'. \n\n#Changes\n\n * add support for addList when uploading files\n * add support for add adding file by file - slow but safe - only limit: each file cannot be larger than 100mb\n * inplemented definitive - single - implementation based on upsertlist operation\n\n#TODO\n * include / excludes blobs\n\n\n\n#QA \n\nthe current implementation of ns-uploader, implUpsertList2 should support the following scenarios:\n\n * deploy in a live/production site - because we use upsert, existing files are updated - this is supposed to be atomic operation well suited for updating live sites in production.\n\n * manifest not updated deploy once, remove a folder, deploy again  - because upsert operation will add the record if not exists\n\n * deploy to an empty folder\n\n * deploy, remove manifest, deploy again - well files are uploaded again - fact of life - we don't have a manifest\n\n\n\nsituations that we are not sure what happens: \n\n * an empty folder with a 'fake' manifest\n\n * deploy, remove a folder entry from the manifest, change something inside that folder, deploy again\n",
